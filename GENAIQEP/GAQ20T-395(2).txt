### 1) Description on code fix:
The issue identified in the RCA indicates that the modal dialogue box is not responsive to screen resizing, which leads to buttons and options being hidden. To fix this, we need to ensure that the modal dialogue box has appropriate CSS styles applied to make it responsive. This typically involves using CSS media queries or flexbox/grid layouts to adjust the modal's size and position based on the viewport dimensions.
