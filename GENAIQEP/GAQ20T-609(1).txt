Based on the information provided, the issue seems to be related to a mismatch in the format of data uploaded to Azure DevOps. The root cause analysis points to either a code handling format mismatch or a configuration error in Azure upload settings. However, the provided code snippets are related to a Flipkart login test and a user service implementation, which do not seem directly related to the bug description concerning Azure DevOps.

Given the details and the code provided, the relevant code for fixing the issue is not present in the snippets. Here is the analysis:

1) Description on code fix:  
   The provided code does not contain any logic related to uploading data to Azure DevOps or handling format conversions. Therefore, no direct code fix can be identified from the provided snippets.

2) Code fix:  
   - Original Code: Not applicable as the relevant code is not present.
   - New Code: Not applicable as the relevant code is not present.

3) Other Relevant details:
   - Ensure that the code responsible for generating and uploading the script is reviewed for format handling logic.
   - Check Azure DevOps configuration settings to ensure they align with the expected script format.
   - Review any integration points between the application and Azure DevOps for potential mismatches or misconfigurations.

In conclusion, without the specific code related to the data generation and upload process, it's not possible to provide a precise code fix. The issue likely resides in a different part of the codebase that handles Azure DevOps interactions.
