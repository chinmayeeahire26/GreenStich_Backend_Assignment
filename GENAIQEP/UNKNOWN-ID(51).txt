1) Description on code fix: 
The defect arises because the Epic artifacts generation API expects specific keywords, namely {feature description} and {feature acceptance criteria}, which are not aligned with the user's expectation of using {epic description} and {acceptance criteria}. This mismatch leads to failures in artifact generation. The fix involves updating the API configuration to accept the expected keywords for epics and ensuring that users are informed about the correct keywords to use. This addresses both the configuration issue and the process issue identified in the RCA.

2) Code fix: 
Relevant Code NOT Found 
The provided code sections do not directly relate to the defect described. The issue is primarily with the API configuration and user guidance, which are not part of the provided code snippets. Therefore, no direct code fix can be applied to the given code sections.

3) Other Relevant details: 
- Testing recommendations: Conduct end-to-end testing of the Epic artifacts generation process to ensure that the API correctly processes prompts with the updated keywords {epic description} and {acceptance criteria}.
- Configuration changes if needed: Update the API configuration to recognize and process the keywords {epic description} and {acceptance criteria} instead of {feature description} and {feature acceptance criteria}.
- Documentation updates: Revise the user documentation to clearly instruct users on the correct keywords to use when writing prompts for Epic artifacts generation. This should include examples and a detailed explanation of the expected input format.
- Any other implementation notes: Consider implementing validation checks within the application to alert users if incorrect keywords are used in prompts, providing immediate feedback and reducing the likelihood of errors.
