### 1) Description on code fix:
The code fix addresses two issues: implementing the download functionality to ensure the file is downloaded in text format instead of CSV, and adjusting the UI margin settings to maintain consistency across screens. The download functionality needs to be added to the relevant section of the code, and UI margin settings should be reviewed in the CSS or layout files.

### 2) Code fix:

Relevant Code NOT Found

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- The current code provided does not include any functionality related to the download button or UI margin settings.
- The implementation of the download feature and UI adjustments would typically be found in a different part of the application, possibly in a controller or service layer, rather than in the test code provided.
- It is recommended to review the application’s frontend code (HTML/CSS) and backend logic to implement the necessary fixes for the download functionality and UI consistency.
