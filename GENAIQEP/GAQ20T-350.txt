### 1) Description on code fix:
The issue arises from the repository selection not resetting its state when a new repository is selected. To fix this, we need to ensure that the state is properly reset and updated whenever a new repository is selected. This involves adding logic to clear the previous repository's state before fetching files from the newly selected repository.

### 2) Code fix:

```java
// Code without the Fix
public void selectRepository(Repository newRepository) {
    // Assuming 'currentRepository' holds the currently selected repository
    if (currentRepository != null) {
        // Logic to fetch files from the current repository
        fetchFiles(currentRepository);
    }
    // Logic to fetch files from the new repository
    fetchFiles(newRepository);
}

// New Code fix
public void selectRepository(Repository newRepository) {
    // Clear previous state before selecting a new repository
    clearPreviousState(); // Fix: Added line to reset state
    
    // Logic to fetch files from the new repository
    fetchFiles(newRepository);
}
```

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- The `clearPreviousState()` method should be implemented to reset any variables or states related to the previously selected repository.
- Ensure that the `fetchFiles()` method is only called after the state has been cleared to avoid fetching outdated data.
- This fix addresses both the code issue and the process issue identified in the RCA by ensuring proper validation and state management.
