To provide a comprehensive analysis and identify a code fix, I need to review the specific section of the codebase that is causing the defect. However, since the actual code is not provided in your message, I will guide you on how to approach this situation based on the RCA and defect details you have provided.

### Steps to Analyze and Fix the Defect:

1. Description on Code Fix:
   - Based on the RCA, the defect appears to be due to a code regression similar to previously fixed defects (CP-6628, CP-5427). The issue might be caused by an oversight during initial implementation, possibly in a section of code that handles logic similar to those past defects.

2. Code Fix:
   - Since the specific code is not provided, I will outline a general approach:
     - Identify the Code Block: Locate the code block that handles the functionality related to the defect. This might involve searching for logic or functions that were affected by the past defects CP-6628 and CP-5427.
     - Compare with Past Fixes: Compare the current implementation with the fixes applied in CP-6628 and CP-5427 to identify discrepancies or missing logic.
     - Implement the Fix: Once identified, apply the necessary changes to correct the oversight or regression.

   Example Format (Hypothetical Code):

   ```plaintext
   // Original Code
   if (condition) {
       // Logic that might be causing the issue
   }

   // Fixed Code
   if (condition && additionalCheck) { // Highlight: Added 'additionalCheck' to prevent regression
       // Corrected Logic
   }
   ```

3. Other Relevant Details:
   - Ensure thorough testing is conducted after applying the fix to prevent similar regressions.
   - Review and update any related documentation to reflect the changes made.
   - Consider implementing additional code reviews or automated tests to catch similar issues in the future.

### Conclusion:

Since the specific code is not provided, this approach outlines the general steps to identify and fix the defect based on the RCA. If you can provide the specific code, I can offer a more detailed and precise solution. Otherwise, the provided steps should help guide you in resolving the issue.
