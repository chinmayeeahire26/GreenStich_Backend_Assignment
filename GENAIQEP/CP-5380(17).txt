To address the defect CP-5380, we need to analyze the provided RCA and the source code. However, since the actual source code is not provided in your request, I will guide you on how to approach this issue based on the RCA details.

### 1) Description on code fix:
The defect appears to be caused by a code misalignment and a configuration mismatch. The code fix would involve aligning the code logic with the intended functionality and ensuring the configuration settings are correctly applied.

### 2) Code fix:
Since the actual code is not provided, I will illustrate a hypothetical example of what a code fix might look like. Let's assume the issue is in a function that calculates a value based on configuration settings.

Before Fix:
```python
def calculate_value(config):
    # Incorrect logic due to misalignment
    if config['mode'] == 'advanced':
        return config['base_value'] * 2
    else:
        return config['base_value'] + 10
```

After Fix:
```python
def calculate_value(config):
    # Corrected logic to align with intended functionality
    if config['mode'] == 'advanced':
        return config['base_value'] * 3  # Highlighted fix: changed multiplier from 2 to 3
    else:
        return config['base_value'] + 5  # Highlighted fix: changed addition from 10 to 5
```

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- Ensure that the configuration settings are correctly loaded and validated before use.
- Verify that the logic aligns with the project requirements and specifications.
- Conduct thorough testing to confirm that the fix resolves the defect without introducing new issues.

If you have the actual source code, please provide it so I can offer a more precise fix. Otherwise, based on the information given, this is a general approach to resolving such issues.
