Based on the information provided, the issue at hand is related to the absence of the "X-Content-Type-Options" header in API responses. This header is typically used to prevent MIME type sniffing, which is a security measure to ensure that the browser does not interpret files as something other than what they are declared to be.

However, the provided code snippets do not contain any API response handling or HTTP header management. They are primarily related to a Selenium WebDriver test for a Flipkart login page and a user service implementation in a Spring application. Therefore, the relevant code for fixing the issue is not found in the provided snippets.
