### 1) Description on code fix:
The code fix involves modifying the prompt validation logic to accept keywords specific to Epic artifacts, such as `{epic description}` and `{acceptance criteria}`, in addition to the existing keywords `{feature description}` and `{feature acceptance criteria}`. This will resolve the issue of users being unable to generate Epic artifacts when using the expected keywords for their prompts.

### 2) Code fix:

Code without the Fix:
```python
def generate_epic_artifacts(prompt):
    if "{feature description}" not in prompt or "{feature acceptance criteria}" not in prompt:
        raise ValueError("Invalid prompt keywords. Please use {feature description} and {feature acceptance criteria}.")
    # Logic to generate epic artifacts
```

New Code Fix:
```python
def generate_epic_artifacts(prompt):
    if ("{feature description}" not in prompt and "{epic description}" not in prompt) or 
       ("{feature acceptance criteria}" not in prompt and "{acceptance criteria}" not in prompt):
        raise ValueError("Invalid prompt keywords. Please use {feature description}, {feature acceptance criteria}, {epic description}, or {acceptance criteria}.")
    # Logic to generate epic artifacts
```

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- The fix enhances user experience by allowing flexibility in the keywords used for prompts, aligning with user expectations.
- Documentation should be updated to reflect the new keywords that can be used for Epic artifacts generation to reduce confusion among users.
