1) Description on code fix: 
The defect involves the 'Select Prompt' dropdown being disabled when a single defect is selected on the Tendency Analysis page. The RCA identifies a code error and a configuration issue as potential causes. The fix should address the logic that enables the dropdown when a single defect is selected. Since the provided code does not directly relate to the dropdown issue, it suggests a pattern of missing error handling and validation. The fix should ensure that the dropdown is enabled when the selection criteria (1 to 50 defects) are met, and any configuration settings that might prevent this should be corrected.

2) Code fix: 
Relevant Code NOT Found 
The provided code snippets do not contain the relevant sections for the dropdown functionality. The issue likely resides in a different part of the codebase, specifically in the UI logic or configuration settings that handle the dropdown's enabled state. Further investigation into the UI component and its configuration is necessary to identify the exact code responsible for enabling the dropdown.

3) Other Relevant details: 
- Testing recommendations: Conduct thorough testing on the Tendency Analysis page to ensure the dropdown is enabled when selecting between 1 and 50 defects. Test edge cases such as selecting 0 or more than 50 defects to verify correct behavior.
- Configuration changes if needed: Review and update any configuration files or settings that might inadvertently disable the dropdown. Ensure that the configuration aligns with the expected behavior of enabling the dropdown for 1 to 50 defect selections.
- Documentation updates: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made to the dropdown logic and configuration settings.
- Any other implementation notes: Consider implementing additional error handling and validation checks in the UI logic to prevent similar issues in the future. This might include logging mechanisms to capture and diagnose issues related to UI component states.
