### 1) Description on code fix:
The issue identified in the RCA pertains to the incorrect order of tasks in the Tendency Analysis workflow. The code does not directly relate to the Tendency Analysis functionality but rather focuses on user login. However, to address the task order issue, we need to ensure that the dropdown for selecting prompts is enabled only after a bug is selected, which may require changes in the UI logic or event handling that is not present in the provided code.

### 2) Code fix:
Relevant Code NOT Found

The provided code is primarily focused on user login functionality and does not include any logic related to the Tendency Analysis workflow or task order. Therefore, no specific code fix can be provided for the identified issue.

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- The issue seems to be more related to the front-end logic and event handling rather than the backend service code provided.
- A review of the front-end code that manages the task sequence and dropdown enabling/disabling is necessary to implement the required fix.
- Collaboration with the front-end development team may be needed to ensure the correct task order is enforced in the user interface.
