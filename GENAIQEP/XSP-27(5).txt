### 1) Description on code fix:
The root cause analysis indicates a mismatch in landing page rendering logic and inadequate page verification in Chrome. The code fix involves adding a verification step after the login process to ensure that the user is successfully logged in and redirected to the correct landing page.

### 2) Code fix:

| Without Fix | With Fix |
|------------------|--------------|
| ```java | ```java |
| // Verify login success | // Verify login success |
| // Add verification logic here | WebElement homePageElement = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("selector_for_home_page_element")); |
| | if (homePageElement.isDisplayed()) { |
| | System.out.println("Login successful, redirected to home page."); |
| | } else { |
| | System.out.println("Login failed or not redirected to home page."); |
| | } |

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- Ensure that the CSS selector used in the verification step accurately targets an element that is only present on the home page after a successful login.
- Consider implementing explicit waits to handle any delays in page loading, which can improve the reliability of the test.
