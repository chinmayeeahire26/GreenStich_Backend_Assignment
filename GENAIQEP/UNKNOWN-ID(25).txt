### 1) Description on code fix:
The issue seems to stem from the data retrieval logic that fetches defects for the sentiment analysis table. The fix would involve reviewing and potentially modifying the data fetching and filtering logic to ensure that all selected defects are correctly identified and listed in the sentiment analysis table.

Relevant Code NOT Found

### 3) Other Relevant details:
- The provided code snippets are related to a login test and a Spring Boot application setup, which do not directly relate to the defect analysis or sentiment analysis logic.
- The root cause analysis indicates issues with data retrieval and filtering, suggesting that the relevant code for fetching and processing defects is likely located in a different part of the application, possibly in a service or repository layer.
