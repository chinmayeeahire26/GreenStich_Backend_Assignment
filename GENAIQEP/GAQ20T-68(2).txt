Based on the provided details, the issue is related to inconsistent formatting in feature descriptions and incorrect input during test case generation. However, since the actual code snippet is not provided, I'll outline a generic approach to address these issues:

1) Description on code fix:
   - The code fix involves ensuring consistent formatting in feature descriptions by applying a standard format template. Additionally, input validation checks should be added to prevent incorrect inputs during test case generation.

2) Code fix:
   Since the actual code is not provided, I'll demonstrate a hypothetical fix:
   
   - Before Fix:
     ```python
     def generate_test_case(description):
         # Code to generate test case
         print("Generating test case for: " + description)
     ```

   - After Fix:
     ```python
     def generate_test_case(description):
         # Ensure description follows a consistent format
         formatted_description = format_description(description)
         # Validate input
         if not validate_input(formatted_description):
             raise ValueError("Invalid input for test case generation.")
         # Code to generate test case
         print("Generating test case for: " + formatted_description)

     def format_description(description):
         # Apply standard formatting rules
         return description.strip().capitalize()

     def validate_input(description):
         # Example validation logic
         return len(description) > 0
     ```

3) Other Relevant details:
   - Ensure all feature descriptions are standardized before processing.
   - Implement comprehensive input validation to catch errors early.
   - Consider adding logging for better traceability of input handling and formatting issues.

Since the actual code is not provided, the above example demonstrates a general approach to addressing the identified issues. If the actual code snippet is available, more specific guidance can be provided.
